This Repository is for the Project Gary (Gamma Radiation Robot) Audio and Alert System.

The Audio-Alert-System provides audio for button presses, and alerts the user if the rover is overheating (internal temp exceeds 50C) or if the environment the robot is in is too humid (relative humidity exceeds 90%).
The alert system also notifies the user if the LAC used to control the actuator has been connected or disconnected, and if AUTO mode has been started or shutdown for the Actuator Controller.
